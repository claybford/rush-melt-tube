Rush Melt Tube is a simple YouTube summarizer, which pulls the English transcript of the video if available (either one the creator uploaded, or an automatically-generated one), and processes it with an AI tool to summarize it.

The extension is ready to work with locally-hosted AI (LM-Studio, Ollama), OpenAI (GPT-4o, etc), or Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc). For each, input the appropriate endpoint URL, model name, and API key in the extension's settings.

To summarize a YouTube video in your current tab, simply click the extension's icon! Will only work on youtube.com.
